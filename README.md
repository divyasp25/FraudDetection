# Fraud Detection using Python
Developed a predictive model that accurately identifies and classifies fraudulent transactions. Detection of fraud is critical for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms to prevent financial losses and maintain trust. 
Hence, I have created a machine learning model that can analyze transaction features and predict the likelihood of fraud using XG Boost Algorithm.
